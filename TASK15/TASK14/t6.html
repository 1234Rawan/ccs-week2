        <div class="Rose">
            <p class="title">Rose</p>
            <p class="b">One of the most-used flowers in beauty products, rose is excellent for dry skin. It is known for its moisturising properties, soothing inflamed skin, treats acne-prone skin, balances the pH levels, controls excess sebum production and has a lovely fragrance!</p>

        <div class="lavender">
            <p class="title">Lavender</p>
            <p class="c">Most commonly used in essential oils, this is known to reduce wrinkles, lighten dark spots on the skin, moisturise the skin and even helps in preventing acne in certain cases. The flower's scent is also known to have a calming effect on the sense and help in promoting sleep.</p>

        <div class="Aster">
            <p class="title2">Aster</p>
            <p class="e">Most of these beautiful perennials are native to Eurasia, with only two from North America — the New York and New England asters. Their one-inch flowers are starbursts of closely packed, narrow petals in intense blue, purple, lilac, pink, or white. They brighten a garden in late summer through fall and are great for attracting butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. Plant asters in well-drained soil, ensuring they get plenty of sun. The word “aster” means star in Greek, and it sparkles as the September birthday flower and also for a 20th wedding anniversary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Azalea">
            <p class="title">Azalea</p>
            <p class="g">One of the hallmarks of late spring are the vivid azaleas that bloom in yards, along trails, and in woodlands. These familiar shrubs are either evergreen or deciduous and display a profusion of white, pink, red, orange, yellow, or purple flowers that cover the bushes. Azaleas prefer shady locations under trees and thrive in acidic soil. But be careful — all parts of the azalea are poisonous.</p>

        <div class="Black-Eyed Susan">
            <p class="title3">Black-Eyed Susan</p>
            <p class="s">Cheerful black-eyed Susans are one of North America’s favorite perennial wildflowers that are frequently seen in fields and meadows. They are a popular addition to a sunny garden since they are hardy, they can tolerate drought and a variety of soils, and they can reseed and come back year after year. Black-eyed Susans are perfect for a beginner gardener. Their jolly orange petals and brown centers represent encouragement and can be given to a friend who could use a bouquet of optimism.</p>
